![Classifier Showdown](https://www.educative.io/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,fit=contain,w=1200/api/page/6001456604774400/image/download/5713346172026880)

## Overview

This project explores the performance of various machine learning classifiers on a dataset. The main objective is to compare different classifiers and identify the best model for the given classification task. The classifiers used in this project include Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Also Shows a graph to show a clear comparision between different Classifiers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is "adult.csv." It contains information about individuals, including features such as age, education level, occupation, marital status, and income.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version x.x)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files from the GitHub repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Requirements section.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the project code.

4. Update the `dataset_path` variable with the correct path to the "adult.csv" file if needed.

5. Run the entire code or the specific sections of interest.

6. Explore the results and analyze the performance of different classifiers.

## File Description

- `classifier_showdown.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis.
- `adult.csv`: The dataset used in the project.

## Results

The project evaluates the classifiers using various metrics, including confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report. The results are displayed in the notebook.

## Conclusion

After comparing the performance of various classifiers, the project concludes with the identification of the best model for the given classification task.
